= What is a corporate action?


A Corporate Action is an activity that a company does which causes an economic change to all holders of an instrument at a particular point in time.
Common corporate actions are stock splits and spin offs.

LUSID allows the details of Corporate Actions to be uploaded into the system, and will then automatically apply them to any xref:reference/portfolio/index.adoc[portfolios] which are configured correctly and hold the affected xref:reference/instrument.adoc[instruments].
