= What is a corporate action?


A corporate action is an activity that a company does that causes an economic change to all holders of an instrument at a particular point in time.
Common corporate actions are stock splits and spin-offs.

LUSID allows the details of corporate actions to be uploaded into the system, and will then automatically apply them to any xref:reference/portfolio/index.adoc[portfolios] which are configured correctly and hold the affected xref:reference/instrument.adoc[instruments].
