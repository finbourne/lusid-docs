= What is a sub holding key (SHK)?

By default, LUSID separates xref:reference/holdings.adoc[holdings] by xref:reference/instrument.adoc[instrument].
i.e. two transactions in the same instrument will contribute to the same holding in that instrument.
This also applies to cash, where separate holdings (balances) are created for each currency.

Sub holding keys let you bucket your holding in one instrument into different groups, giving a more granular break down of holdings.
Examples of where we might use sub holding keys could be if:

* You want to account for different types of cash balances
e.g. principal, income, margin

* You want to segregate holdings in a single instrument based on a strategy tag supplied with the transaction, allowing the performance of individual strategies to be calculated - see how are Subholding keys used to capture different investment strategies?


A sub-holding key is a xref:how-to/user-defined-properties.adoc[user defined property] that is specified on xref:reference/portfolio/index.adoc[portfolio] creation and when xref:how-to/load-transactions.adoc[loading transactions] or xref:how-to/holdings/set-holdings.adoc[setting holdings].

[WARNING]
====
Since they play such a critical part in how holdings are calculated by LUSID, it is not possible to update a portfolio's sub-holding keys after it has been created.
