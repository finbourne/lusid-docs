= What is a movement?
:description: A movement is a change to the quantity and/or cost of a holding in a portfolio.

A movement is a change to the quantity and/or cost of a holding.
It forms part of a xref:reference/transaction-types/index.adoc[transaction type].

To generate a xref:reference/holdings.adoc[portfolio's holdings], each transaction in LUSID is decomposed into its underlying economic movements by xref:explanation/movements-engine.adoc[the movements engine].

For example, if you had a "Buy" transaction for 100 Vodafone common shares for a total cost of £146.66, this would be made up of two movements:

. An increase of 100 in the units of Vodafone common shares on the transaction date, and the same increase in the settled units on the settlement date.

. The creation of a separate GBP cash commitment of -£146.66 on the transaction date, and a reduction in your GBP cash balance of £146.66 on the settlement date.

In the rest of this guide we'll walk through the parts of a movement.

== Movement Types

The movement type is responsible for how and when the holding is updated.
The following base  movement types are supported:

.Base movement types
[opts="header", cols="20,80"]
|===
| Movement type | Description
| Settlement | Updates the settlement-date position of the instrument
| Traded | Updates the trade-date position of the instrument
| ForwardFx | A transfer of funds from one currency balance to another at a future point in time
| Commitment | Updates the cash amount to reflect that it is committed to settling a trade
| Receivable | Updates the cash amount to reflect that it is soon to be received from settlement of a trade
| Accrual | Updates the cash amount to indicate that it has accrued from an interest bearing instrument
| CashSettlement | Updates the cash amount to reflect that it has been settled
| Carry | Description
| CarryAsPnl | Description
| FutureCash | Description

There are also movement types composed of the base movement types.
These are described below:

| CashForward | FutureCash, CashSettlement

| UnsettledCashTypes | FutureCash, Receivable, Commitment, Accrual, ForwardFx

The diagram below breaks down the movement types for the Vodafone example described above.

Some of these movement types are a single movement type that only affect the holding on either the transaction date, OR the settlement date (the ones in yellow with a dashed border).

The others are a combined type which consist of the combination of two single movement types (the ones in red with a solid border).
One Movement Type for the transaction date and one for the settlement date.

The first movement has a movement type of _StockMovement_.
This is a combination of the _Traded_ and _Settlement_ movement types and does the following:

* Updates the units of the Vodafone position on the transaction date (the _Traded_ movement type)
* Updates the settled units of the position on the settlement date (the _Settlement_ movement type).

The second movement has a movement type of _CashCommitment_.
This is a combination of the _Commitment_ and _CashSettlement_ movement types and does the following:

* Creates a GBP cash commitment on the transaction date (the _Commitment_ movement type)
* Reduces the GBP cash balance on the settlement date (the _CashSettlement_ movement type).

== Side

Where the movement type is responsible for how and when a holding updated, the side is responsible for what it is updated with.

The side describes which attribute on a transaction should determine the security and currency of the holding to be updated, by how many units, and the amount by which the holding's cost should be updated.

In the Vodafone example above, the default side of _Side1_ is used in the first movement.
This picks the units, amount, and security from the core required fields on the transaction.

In the second movement, the default side of _Side2_ is used.
This picks the units, amount, and cash currency from the core required fields on the transaction.

You can create custom sides that pick other attributes such as commission.

== Direction

The direction of the Movement describes whether the change in the units and the amount of the holding is in a positive or negative direction.
This is indicated by either `1` or `-1`.

For the Vodafone example above the first movement has a direction of 1.
The second movement has a direction of -1.

[WARNING]
====
It is important to think about how the direction works with the side, as if your units and amount are signed
(e.g. the units field is -30 for a sell transaction and 30 for a buy transaction) then *a negative direction will have the effect of reversing the sign and could lead to unintended results*.
====

== Mappings

Mappings allow you to set transaction properties on each movement separately.
These properties can either be mapped from a property that is already on the transaction or set to a static value.

This allows you to separate the movements in different categories when generating holdings.
For example, you may want to tag cash flow types such as _Commission_ vs _Dividend_.
