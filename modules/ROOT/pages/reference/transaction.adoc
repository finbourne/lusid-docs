= What is a transaction?

A transaction is an economic change to a portfolio.
Transactions can be one-sided (e.g. cash inflow) or two-sided (e.g. an equity trade purchasing stock and settling cash).

This model is intended to be flexible and customisable by the client.
A client configures xref:reference/transaction-types/index.adoc[transaction types] in LUSID which maps from the fields and properties on the transaction onto a set of xref:reference/transaction-types/movement.adoc[movements] which represent the economic changes.

A minimal set of mandatory transaction fields have been defined for each domain type.
The transaction data model can be extended by adding additional properties to a transaction.
