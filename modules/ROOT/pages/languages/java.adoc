:description: This guide covers the Java SDK for LUSID by FINBOURNE.
:tabs:

This guide will help you get started with building applications with LUSID by FINBOURNE and the Java programming language.

FINBOURNE develops and maintains two versions of the LUSIDÂ® Java SDK:

https://github.com/finbourne/lusid-sdk-java[lusid-sdk-java^] ::
supports `Production` and `Early Access` API endpoints
https://github.com/finbourne/lusid-sdk-java-preview[lusid-sdk-java-preview^] ::
supports `Production`, `Early Access`, `Beta` and `Experimental` API endpoints.

include::partial$api-endpoints.adoc[]

[NOTE]
====
You should only use `lusid-sdk-java-preview` if you want to use the `Beta` or `Experimental` API endpoints.
====

== Installation

The SDK is available on the Open Source Software Repository Hosting (OSSRH). 

include::partial$installation/java.adoc[tag="ossrh"]

And now add the following dependency:

include::partial$installation/java.adoc[tag="java-sdk"]

To use the preview version of the SDK, you can instead add the following dependency:

include::partial$installation/java.adoc[tag="java-preview-sdk"]


== Configuring API Client

Now that you've installed the SDK, it's time to use it. 
First, import the following modules:

[source, java]
----
include::example$getting-started/HelloWorld.java[tag="lusid-imports"]
----

You can create the API client by running the following code:

.Java
[source, java, indent=0]
----
include::example$getting-started/HelloWorld.java[tag="create-client-factory"]
----

include::partial$credentials.adoc[]

Now that the API client is ready, you are ready to use the various API endpoints. 
For example, to construct the Transactions Portfolio API, run the following:

[source, java, indent=0]
----
include::example$getting-started/HelloWorld.java[tag="create-tx-portfolios-api"]
----

For a worked example showing how to use the Java SDK for a simple workflow, see xref:lusid:get-started/quick-start.adoc[].
