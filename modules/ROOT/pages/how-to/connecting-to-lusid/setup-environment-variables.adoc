:page-pagination: true

In this guide you will set up LUSID credentials in environment variables for use with the LUSID API and xref:languages/index.adoc[LUSID SDKs].
The LUSID SDKs all support credentials defined as environment variables or in a xref:how-to/connecting-to-lusid/configure-secrets-file.adoc[secrets file].
You can choose whichever approach better suits your circumstances.

== Pre Requisites

You'll need to have created a LUSID application before following the instructions in this guide.
If you haven't yet created an application, see xref:how-to/connecting-to-lusid/create-application.adoc[].
