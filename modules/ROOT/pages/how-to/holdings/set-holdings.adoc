= How to set holdings of a portfolio

:description: In this guide we'll set the holdings of a transaction portfolio.

In this guide we'll set the xref:reference/holdings.adoc[holdings] of a xref:reference/portfolio/transaction-portfolio.adoc[transaction portfolio].
We might want to do this if we have a set of positions, but don't have transaction data to create those positions.
LUSID will automatically construct adjustment transactions based on the holdings we provide.

== Pre Requisites

This guide assumes that you have xref:how-to/portfolios/create-transaction-portfolio-sub-holding-key.adoc[created a transaction portfolio with sub holding key] and imported the instruments described in xref:how-to/maintain-instruments-master.adoc[].

== Setup

Import the following modules into your Python script:

[source, python, indent=0]
----
include::example$ibor/test_ibor.py[tag="imports-lusid"]
include::example$ibor/test_ibor.py[tag="imports-pandas"]
include::example$ibor/test_ibor.py[tag="imports-dates"]
----

You can specify your own scope and portfolio code by updating the line below:

[source, python, indent=0]
----
include::example$ibor/test_ibor.py[tag="scope"]
include::example$ibor/test_ibor.py[tag="portfolio-code-shk-override"]
----

This guide assumes that you have created a strategy property key, as described below:

[source, python, indent=0]
----
include::example$ibor/test_ibor.py[tag="sub-holding-key-property"]
include::example$ibor/test_ibor.py[tag="portfolio-with-shk-property-key"]
----

== Initialise API

Initialise the Transaction Portfolios API.

[source, python, indent=0]
----
include::example$ibor/test_ibor.py[tag="set-holdings-api"]
----

== Our Holdings

We have holdings of three instruments stored in the following CSV file:

[source, python, indent=0]
----
include::example$ibor/test_ibor.py[tag="holdings-file"]
include::example$ibor/test_ibor.py[tag="load-holdings"]
----

.Holdings
[format="csv", options="header"]
|===
include::example$ibor/holdings.csv[]
|===

From this table, we can see that our portfolio holds 100 units of Amazon stock, 300 units of Apple, and 500 units of CoinBase.
In this guide we aren't interested in the amount that it cost us to buy these instruments.

== API calls

There are two ways to set the holdings on a portfolio:

* SetHoldings: *replaces a portfolio's current holdings* with the supplied holdings.
Holdings in instruments that are not included in the supplied holdings will be removed (i.e. reduced to zero).

* AdjustHoldings: *augments a portfolio's current holdings* with the supplied holdings.
Holdings in instruments that are not included in the supplied holdings are left untouched.

=== Set Holdings

To set the holdings on a transaction portfolio, use the `set_holdings` function, as shown below:

[source, python]
----
include::example$ibor/test_ibor.py[tag="set-holdings", indent=0]
----

[TIP]
====
If you don't want to associate a sub holding key with the holdings, remove the _sub_holdings_keys_ argument.
====


=== Adjust Holdings

To adjust the holdings on a transaction portfolio, use the `adjust_holdings` function, as shown below:

[source, python, indent=0]
----
include::example$ibor/test_ibor.py[tag="adjust-holdings"]
----

[TIP]
====
If you don't want to associate a sub holding key with the holdings, remove the _sub_holdings_keys_ argument.
