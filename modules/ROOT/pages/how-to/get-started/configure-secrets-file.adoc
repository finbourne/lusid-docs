:description: This guide walks through how to configure the secrets file that contains credentials for the LUSID API.
:page-pagination: true

In this guide you'll learn how to create a secrets file for use with the LUSID API and xref:languages/index.adoc[LUSID SDKs].

[NOTE]
====
You'll need to have created a LUSID application before following the instructions in this guide.
If you haven't yet created an application, see xref:how-to/get-started/create-application.adoc[].
====

From the LUSID home page, navigate to the Applications page.
To do this, click on the person icon on the left hand menu and then click on the `Applications` link:

.Open the application

Once you're on this page, click on the eye icon. 
You'll see the following screen: 

.Application credentials
image::secrets-part-1.png[]

Now you'll need to create a JSON file based on these values.

.secrets.json

{
  "api" : {
    "apiUrl": "<1>",
    "tokenUrl": "<2>",
    "clientId": "<3>",
    "clientSecret": "<4>",
    "applicationName": "<applicationName>",
    "username": "<username>",
    "password": "<password>"
  }
}

| Token | JSON key | LUSID web app | Description 
| `<1>` | `apiUrl` | `API Url` | LUSID API URL
| `<2>` | `tokenUrl` | `Token Url` | Okta endpoint to generate authentication token
| `<3>` | `clientId` | `Client Id` |  OpenID Connect Client ID
| `<4>` | `clientSecret` | `Secret` |  OpenID Connect Client Secret
| `<applicationName>` | `applicationName` | N/A |  An optional identifier for your application
| `<username>` | `username` | N/A |  Username of the account accessing the API (e.g. email used in xref:how-to/get-started/create-account.adoc[])
| `<password>` | `password` | N/A |  Password of the account accessing the API (e.g. password used in xref:how-to/get-started/create-account.adoc[])
|===

[NOTE]
====
While you are learning the LUSID API you can use the `username` and `password` that you used to create your account, but once you want to have multiple users access LUSID, you'll need to create additional users or service accounts.
For more information, see xref:how-to/access-control/index.adoc[].
