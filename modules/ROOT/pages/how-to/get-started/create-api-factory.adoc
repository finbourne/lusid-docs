= Create an API Factory
:description: In this guide we'll create an API factory that can be used to connect to LUSID.

{description}

We'll be using the https://github.com/finbourne/lusid-python-tools[LUSID Python Tools library^], which you can install by running the following:

[source, bash]
----
pip install lusidtools
----

Once you've got that installed, import the following modules:

[source, python, indent=0]
----
include::example$lusid_utils.py[tag="imports"]
----

== Secrets file

You can then create an API factory from a secrets file:

include::partial$api-factory.adoc[tag]

== Environment variables

Or you can create an API factory from environment variables:

[source, python, indent=0]
----
include::example$lusid_utils.py[tag="api-factory-env-variables"]
----

[NOTE]
====
You will need to create environment variables containing your LUSID credentials.
For instructions on how to do this, see xref:how-to/get-started/setup-environment-variables.adoc[].
