= Set up environment variables
:description: In this guide you will set up LUSID credentials in environment variables for use with the LUSID SDKs.

In this guide you will set up LUSID credentials in environment variables for use with the LUSID API and xref:languages/index.adoc[LUSID SDKs].
The LUSID SDKs all support credentials defined as environment variables or in a xref:how-to/get-started/configure-secrets-file.adoc[secrets file].
You can choose whichever approach better suits your circumstances.

[NOTE]
====
You'll need to have created a LUSID application before following the instructions in this guide.
If you haven't yet created an application, see xref:how-to/get-started/create-application.adoc[].
