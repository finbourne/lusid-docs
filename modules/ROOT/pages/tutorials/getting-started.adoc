= Getting started with LUSID

In this guide we'll get up and running with LUSID.
You will create and log into your account, create a LUSID application, and then connect to LUSID via its API.

== Create account

First you need to create an account.
LUSID offers a 30-day trial, which should give you enough time to see what it does and whether it works for you.

Navigate to https://www.lusid.com/app/signup[lusid.com/app/signup], where you'll see the following screen:

.Create Account
image::account-part-0.png[]

Populate your details and click on `Create Account`.
You'll then be taken to the following screen:

.Create Domain
image::account-part-1.png[]

Choose a domain and click on `Create domain`

[NOTE]
====
You will use this domain for all future interactions with LUSID, so choose a name that you actually want to use!
====

Once you've done that, you'll need to read and click through terms and a data processing agreement:

.Evaluation Use Terms

.Data Processing Agreement
image::account-part-3.png[width=400]

After that, all being well, you'll see the following success screen:

.Success
image::account-part-4.png[]

You should also now have an email confirmation.
You'll need to view that email to finalise account creation.

.Email Confirmation
image::account-part-5.png[]

Click on `Activate my LUSID account` and set up your password and 2-factor authentication.

Once you've done that, you're ready to login to your account.

== Login to account

Now you'll need navigate to your LUSID domain.
e.g. `yourname.lusid.com`.
You'll see the screen below:

.Click on the `Open LUSID` button
image::application-part-0.png[]

Click on `Open LUSID` under the `APPLICATION` section.
If you aren't logged in you'll see the following screen, which has two `Sign-in` buttons:

.Click on the `Sign-in` button
image::application-part-1.png[]

Clicking on one of them will take you to the following screen, where you should enter the credentials that you created in the first section.

.Populate your credentials
image::application-part-2.png[width=400]

Once you've filled in your credentials, click on the `Sign In` button.
You'll then be redirected to the LUSID home page.

== Create Personal Access Token

Next we're going to create a Personal Access Token that we'll use to authenticate requests against the LUSID API.

Click on the Person icon in the top right-hand corner and then select _Your Profile_:

.Navigate to your profile
image::profile-0.png[]

Find the _Personal access tokens_ section of this screen.
Choose a _Name_ and optional _Expiry Date_ for your token and then click on _Create token_:

.Create token
image::pat-0.png[]

You'll then see the _Personal Access Token_ overlay, which contains your token:

.Copy your token
image::pat-1.png[]

[WARNING]
====
You won't be able to access this token after you click the _Close_ button, so make sure you've copied it somewhere.
====

== Connecting to the LUSID API

Now we're going to make our first API call using the cURL command line tool.
Update the following command with your LUSID domain/tenant, and the personal access token that you just created:

[source, bash]
----
curl -v "https://<yourname>.lusid.com/api/api/instruments?limit=5" \
-H "Authorization: Bearer <personal-access-token>"
----

[NOTE]
====
The URL does intentionally contain the `api` string twice in a row!
====

Everything being well, you will see a response that contains a JSON document describing 5 of LUSID's pre-loaded xref:reference/instrument.adoc[instruments].

[TIP]
====
If you receive a `400` status code then you might not have copy/pasted your personal token access token properly.
Check that you've got the correct value and if it's still not working, try creating a new personal access token.
====

The raw output of cURL isn't particularly easy to read, but you can pipe the output into the https://stedolan.github.io/jq/[jq command line JSON processor^] to get something more readable:


[source, bash]
----
curl -v "https://<yourname>.lusid.com/api/api/instruments?limit=5" \
-H "Authorization: Bearer <personal-access-token>" 2>/dev/null | jq '.'
----

You should see something like the following output:

[source,json]
