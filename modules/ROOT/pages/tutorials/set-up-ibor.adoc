= Set up an IBOR (Investment Book of Record)

image:noun_Book Of Commerce_175562.png[float="right", width="100px"]

Using LUSID to manage an investment book of record (IBOR) is a common use case.
In this guide we'll walk through how to create a portfolio, load an instruments master, import transactions and quotes, add a corporate action, view transactions, and view holdings.

== Pre Requisites

This guide assumes that you have followed the xref:tutorials/getting-started.adoc[] tutorial and have created and logged into your LUSID account.

== Installation

We'll be using the https://github.com/finbourne/lusid-sdk-python-preview[LUSID Python Preview SDK^] and Pandas libraries.
You can install these libraries by running the following:

[source, bash]
----
pip install lusid-sdk-preview pandas
----

== Setup

Import the following modules into your Python script:

[source, python, indent=0]
----
include::example$ibor/test_ibor.py[tag="imports-lusid"]
include::example$ibor/test_ibor.py[tag="imports-pandas"]
include::example$ibor/test_ibor.py[tag="imports-dates"]
----

== Create LUSID application

We need to create a LUSID application so that we can interact with LUSID using language SDKs.

Navigate to your LUSID domain e.g. `yourname.lusid.com` and, after you've logged in, click on the person icon on the left-hand menu and then click on the `Applications` link.

.Select the person icon followed by `Applications`
image::application-part-3.png[]

You'll see the following screen:

.Create a new application
image::application-part-4.png[]

Create a new application by clicking on the `Create application` link, choose a `Client Id` and `Display Name`, and then click on the `SAVE` button.

[NOTE]
====
The `Client Id` must be a string with no spaces.
====

You'll then see the following screen if the application has been created:

.Application created
image::application-part-5.png[]

== Setup environment variables

Let's set up our LUSID credentials.
Click on the eye icon next to the application that we just set up.
You'll see the following screen:

.Application credentials
image::secrets-part-1.png[]

We're going to define the following environment variables:

include::partial$credentials/auth-mapping.adoc[]

[.tabs]

.Unix or Mac OS X
[source, bash]
----
export FBN_LUSID_API_URL="<1>"
export FBN_TOKEN_URL="<2>"
export FBN_CLIENT_ID="<3>"
export FBN_CLIENT_SECRET="<4>"
export FBN_USERNAME="<username>"
export FBN_PASSWORD="<password>"
----

.Windows
[source, powershell]
----
setx FBN_LUSID_API_URL "<1>"
setx FBN_TOKEN_URL "<2>"
setx FBN_CLIENT_ID "<3>"
setx FBN_CLIENT_SECRET "<4>"
setx FBN_USERNAME "<username>"
setx FBN_PASSWORD "<password>"
----

== Configure API Factory

Next we'll create an API factory so that we can connect to LUSID.

[source, python, indent=0]
----
include::example$lusid_utils.py[tag="api-factory-env-variables"]
----

As long as we don't get any exceptions when running this line, we're good to go!

== Initialise APIs

We're going to be using several APIs in this tutorial, so let's initialise those:

[source, python, indent=0]
----
include::example$ibor/test_ibor.py[tag="instruments-api"]
include::example$ibor/test_ibor.py[tag="create-portfolio-api"]
include::example$ibor/test_ibor.py[tag="corporate-action-source-api"]
include::example$ibor/test_ibor.py[tag="property-api"]
----

== Instruments master

Next we'll create an instruments master.
xref:reference/instrument.adoc[Instruments] in LUSID are used to represent financial assets that you own or have exposure to.

Our instruments are stored in a CSV file, so we'll first load that into a Pandas DataFrame:

[source, python, indent=0]
----
include::example$ibor/test_ibor.py[tag="instruments-file"]
include::example$ibor/test_ibor.py[tag="load-instruments"]
----

.instruments
[format="csv", options="header"]
|===
include::example$ibor/instruments.csv[]
|===

We've got a mix of equities and government bonds.
Let's load those instruments into LUSID.

Any instrument imported into LUSID must have at least one unique identifier.
A list of valid identifiers is described in xref:how-to/instrument-identifiers.adoc[].
Each of our instruments has a Figi and ClientInternal identifier, so we will use both of those as identifiers.

We'll need to do some mapping between the column names in our DataFrame and those expected by the LUSID API.
`client_internal` becomes `ClientInternal` and `figi` becomes `Figi`.

You can import the instruments by running the following code:

[source, python, indent=0]
----
include::example$ibor/test_ibor.py[tag="import-instruments"]
----

The results from importing these instruments are converted into the Pandas DataFrame shown below:

.LUIDs
[format="csv", options="header"]
|===
include::example$ibor/luids.csv[]
|===

The `LUID` column contains a xref:reference/lusid-unique-instrument-identifier-luid.adoc[LUSID Unique Instrument Identifier], a unique identifier created by LUSID for each instrument.

We can check that those instruments have been imported by trying to retrieve them.
For example, you can run the following code to retrieve the Amazon and CoinBase instruments by their Figi codes:

[source, python, indent=0]
----
include::example$ibor/test_ibor.py[tag="get-instruments"]
----

.Instruments by FIGI
[format="csv", options="header"]
|===
include::example$ibor/get_instruments.csv[]
|===

== Create a transaction portfolio

Now we're going to create a transaction portfolio with a xref:reference/sub-holding-key.adoc[sub holding key].

A transaction portfolio acts as a container that records a transaction history of economic events such as transactions and corporate actions.

Sub holding keys let you bucket holdings in one instrument into different groups, giving a more granular break down of holdings.
We'll create a sub holding key to represent the investment strategy of each of our transactions.

First, we're going to define a scope.
A scope is a logical data partition within which our other data entities live.
We'll be using a single scope for this tutorial.

We don't have to explicitly create a scope, it will be created the first time that we reference it.
In this tutorial we'll use the _Developer-IBOR-Tutorial_ scope:

[source, python, indent=0]
----
include::example$ibor/test_ibor.py[tag="scope"]
----

You'll also need to provide a code for the transaction portfolio:

[source, python, indent=0]
----
include::example$ibor/test_ibor.py[tag="portfolio-code-shk"]
----

Before we create the transaction portfolio, we need to create a property to use as a sub holding key.
This property needs to have a domain of _Transaction_ and must have the same scope that we use for other entities, but the property code can be any value that we want.
You can create a property by running the following code:

[source, python, indent=0]
----
include::example$ibor/test_ibor.py[tag="sub-holding-key-property"]
include::example$ibor/test_ibor.py[tag="create-sub-holding-key-property"]
----

.Output
[source, text]
----
Transaction/Developer-IBOR-Tutorial/strategy
----

Now let's create a transaction portfolio using that property as sub holding key:

[source, python, indent=0]
----
include::example$ibor/test_ibor.py[tag="portfolio-with-shk-property-key"]
include::example$ibor/test_ibor.py[tag="create-portfolio-with-shk"]
----
<1> Our property becomes a sub holding key by passing it to the `sub_holding_keys` parameter when creating a portfolio.

We need to make sure that the _created_ data for the portfolio is earlier than the dates of any transactions against that portfolio, otherwise the transactions will be rejected when we try to load them.

== Set initial holdings for instruments

Now let's set some initial holdings for our portfolio.
We might want to do this if we have positions in some instruments, but don't have details of the underlying transactions that formed those positions.

The following file contains holdings in Amazon, Apple, and CoinBase, for both of our strategies:

[source, python, indent=0]
----
include::example$ibor/test_ibor.py[tag="holdings-file"]
include::example$ibor/test_ibor.py[tag="load-holdings"]
----

.Holdings as of 31st December 2019
[format="csv", options="header", role="word-wrap", cols="30,10,18,12,15,15"]
|===
include::example$ibor/holdings.csv[]
|===

You can load these holdings by running the following code:

[source, python, indent=0]
----
include::example$ibor/test_ibor.py[tag="set-holdings-shk"]
----

These holdings will be booked on 31st December 2019.

[[book-transactions]]
== Book transactions against instruments

We can also import transactions directly.
We have details of transactions, and their accompanying instruments in a CSV file described below:

[source, python, indent=0]
----
include::example$ibor/test_ibor.py[tag="transactions-file"]
include::example$ibor/test_ibor.py[tag="load-transactions"]
----

.Transactions
[format="csv", options="header", role="word-wrap", cols="10,11,10,12,7,10,10,8,12,10"]
|===
include::example$ibor/transactions.csv[]
|===

[TIP]
====
We are using the built-in transaction types _FundsIn_ and _Buy_, where:

* _FundsIn_ represents cash being added to our portfolio
* _Buy_ represents the purchase of an instrument, and the deduction of a corresponding amount of cash.

For a full list of transaction types, see the xref:reference/transaction-types/index.adoc#default-transaction-types[transaction types reference guide].
====

The strategy for each transaction is described in the _strategy_ field of the DataFrame.
We'll store the strategy on each transaction using the strategy property that we created earlier.
You can import transactions by running the following code:

[source,python,indent=0]
----
include::example$ibor/test_ibor.py[tag="import-transactions-shk"]
----
<1> Sub holding key properties are specified as normal properties on transactions

[NOTE]
====
For the transaction that loads cash into our portfolio we need to use a different identifier than for the shares.
For more information about instrument identifiers, see xref:ROOT:how-to/instrument-identifiers.adoc[].
====

== Specify a corporate action

A xref:reference/corporate-action.adoc[corporate action] is an activity that a company does that causes an economic change to all holders of an instrument at a particular point in time.
Common corporate actions are stock splits, spin-offs, and dividends.

Before creating a corporate action, we need to create a corporate action source.
This is where any corporate actions that we create will be stored.
You can create a corporate action source by running the following code:

[source, python, indent=0]
----
include::example$ibor/test_ibor.py[tag="corporate-action-source-code"]

include::example$ibor/test_ibor.py[tag="create-corporate-action-source"]
----

And then attach that corporate action source to our transaction portfolio:

[source, python, indent=0]
----
include::example$ibor/test_ibor.py[tag="corporate-action-created-at"]
include::example$ibor/test_ibor.py[tag="add-corporate-action-portfolio"]
----

Now we're going to create a corporate action that represents a $10 dividend for each Coinbase share.

We'll need to create a Corporate Action Transition Request to do this.
Corporate Action Transition Requests are formed of input and output transitions, in which we specify the ratio of units and cost to apply.

In our case for every 1 unit of CoinBase (`Figi: "BBG00ZGF7HS6"`), we should get 10 units of USD.
You can create the following Corporate Action Transition Request to represent this transition:

[source, python, indent=0]
----
include::example$ibor/test_ibor.py[tag="create-transition"]
----

When we create a corporate action, we also need to define announcement, ex-dividend, record, and payment dates.
We'll set those to be a range of dates from 1st February 2020 through the 4th February 2020.

You can apply this corporate action by running the following code:

[source, python, indent=0]
----
include::example$ibor/test_ibor.py[tag="upsert-transition"]
----

This will mean that from the 4th February 2020, our portfolio will have an extra $10 for each CoinBase share that we held on that date.
We had 1,000 CoinBase shares, so that translates into $10,000.

== Examine input and output transactions

Let's now query the data that we've imported.
We'll start by retrieving the transactions that we loaded, which you can do using the code below:

[source, python, indent=0]
----
include::example$ibor/test_ibor.py[tag="get-transactions"]
----

The following function formats the response:


[source, python, indent=0]
----
include::example$ibor/test_ibor.py[tag="format-transactions"]
----

You can apply that function to the response, as shown below:

[source, python, indent=0]
----
include::example$ibor/test_ibor.py[tag="format-get-transactions"]
----

.Input Transactions
[format="csv", options="header", role="word-wrap", cols="15,35,10,20,20"]
|===
include::example$ibor/transactions_response.csv[]
|===

This DataFrame contains the transactions that we explicitly created, so it reflects the DataFrame in the  <<book-transactions>> section.

We can, however, also return transactions that weren't explicitly created.
For example:

* When we created initial holdings, LUSID created transactions to represent each of those positions.
* When we created the CoinBase corporation action, LUSID created transactions to represent the dividend.

You can get back a list of all transactions by running the following code:

[source, python, indent=0]
----
include::example$ibor/test_ibor.py[tag="get-output-transactions"]
----

We'll use the following function to format the response:

[source, python, indent=0]
----
include::example$ibor/test_ibor.py[tag="format-output-transactions"]
----

You can apply that function to the response, as shown below:

[source, python, indent=0]
----
include::example$ibor/test_ibor.py[tag="format-get-transactions"]
----

.Output Transactions
[format="csv", options="header", role="word-wrap", cols="17,15,25,10,10,23"]
|===
include::example$ibor/transactions_response_all.csv[]
|===

The first 6 rows are transactions that set our initial holdings.
There's one transaction for each instrument/strategy pair.
The last 2 rows are the dividend for our CoinBase holdings.
We received $10 per share, which gets split across our two strategies.
