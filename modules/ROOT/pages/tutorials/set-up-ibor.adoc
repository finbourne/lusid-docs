= Set up an IBOR (Investment Book of Record)

image:noun_Book Of Commerce_175562.png[float="right", width="100px"]

Using LUSID to manage an investment book of record (IBOR) is a common use case.
In this guide we'll walk through how to create a portfolio, load an instruments master, import transactions and quotes, view holdings, and value our portfolio.

== Pre Requisites

This guide assumes that you have followed the xref:tutorials/getting-started.adoc[] tutorial and have created and logged into your LUSID account.

== Installation

We'll be using the https://github.com/finbourne/lusid-sdk-python-preview[LUSID Python Preview SDK^], which you can install by running the following:

[source, bash]
----
pip install lusid-sdk-preview
----

== Setup

Import the following modules into your Python script:

[source, python, indent=0]
----
include::example$ibor/test_ibor.py[tag="imports-lusid"]
include::example$ibor/test_ibor.py[tag="imports-pandas"]
include::example$ibor/test_ibor.py[tag="imports-dates"]
----

== Create LUSID application

We need to create a LUSID application so that we can interact with LUSID using language SDKs.

Navigate to your LUSID domain e.g. `yourname.lusid.com` and, after you've logged in, click on the person icon on the left-hand menu and then click on the `Applications` link.

.Select the person icon followed by `Applications`
image::application-part-3.png[]

You'll see the following screen:

.Create a new application
image::application-part-4.png[]

Create a new application by clicking on the `Create application` link, choose a `Client Id` and `Display Name`, and then click on the `SAVE` button.

[NOTE]
====
The `Client Id` must be a string with no spaces.
====

You'll then see the following screen if the application has been created:

.Application created
image::application-part-5.png[]

== Setup environment variables

Let's set up our LUSID credentials.
Click on the eye icon next to the application that we just set up.
You'll see the following screen:

.Application credentials
image::secrets-part-1.png[]

We're going to define the following environment variables:

include::partial$credentials/auth-mapping.adoc[]

[.tabs]

.Unix or Mac OS X
[source, bash]
----
export FBN_LUSID_API_URL="<1>"
export FBN_TOKEN_URL="<2>"
export FBN_CLIENT_ID="<3>"
export FBN_CLIENT_SECRET="<4>"
export FBN_USERNAME="<username>"
export FBN_PASSWORD="<password>"
----

.Windows
[source, powershell]
----
setx FBN_LUSID_API_URL "<1>"
setx FBN_TOKEN_URL "<2>"
setx FBN_CLIENT_ID "<3>"
setx FBN_CLIENT_SECRET "<4>"
setx FBN_USERNAME "<username>"
setx FBN_PASSWORD "<password>"
----

== Configure API Factory

Next we'll create an API factory so that we can connect to LUSID.

[source, python, indent=0]
----
include::example$lusid_utils.py[tag="api-factory-env-variables"]
----

As long as we don't get any exceptions when running this line, we're good to go!

== Initialise APIs

We're going to be using several APIs in this tutorial, so let's initialise those:

[source, python, indent=0]
----
include::example$ibor/test_ibor.py[tag="instruments-api"]
include::example$ibor/test_ibor.py[tag="create-portfolio-api"]
include::example$ibor/test_ibor.py[tag="corporate-action-source-api"]
include::example$ibor/test_ibor.py[tag="property-api"]
----

== Instruments master

Before we import instruments into LUSID, let's have a look at what we have.
Our instruments are stored in a CSV file, so we'll first load that into a Pandas DataFrame:

[source, python, indent=0]
----
include::example$ibor/test_ibor.py[tag="instruments-file"]
include::example$ibor/test_ibor.py[tag="load-instruments"]
----

.instruments
[format="csv", options="header"]
|===
include::example$ibor/instruments.csv[]
|===

We've got a mix of equities and government bonds.
Let's get those instruments into LUSID.

Any instrument imported into LUSID must have at least one unique identifier.
A list of valid identifiers is described in xref:how-to/instrument-identifiers.adoc[].
Each of our instruments has a Figi and ClientInternal identifier, so we will use both of those as identifiers.

We'll need to do some mapping between the column names in our DataFrame and those expected by the LUSID API.
`client_internal` becomes `ClientInternal` and `figi` becomes `Figi`.

You can import the instruments by running the following code:

[source, python, indent=0]
----
include::example$ibor/test_ibor.py[tag="import-instruments"]
----

The results from importing these instruments are converted into the Pandas DataFrame shown below:

.LUIDs
[format="csv", options="header"]
|===
include::example$ibor/luids.csv[]
|===

The extra thing added is the `LUID` column, which contains a xref:reference/lusid-unique-instrument-identifier-luid.adoc[LUSID Unique Instrument Identifier].

== Create a transaction portfolio

Now we're going to create a transaction portfolio with a xref:reference/sub-holding-key.adoc[sub holding key].

Sub holding keys let you bucket holdings in one instrument into different groups, giving a more granular break down of holdings.
We'll create a sub holding key to represent the investment strategy of each of our transactions.

Define a scope, portfolio code, and property code:

[source, python, indent=0]
----
include::example$ibor/test_ibor.py[tag="scope"]
include::example$ibor/test_ibor.py[tag="portfolio-code-shk"]
include::example$ibor/test_ibor.py[tag="sub-holding-key-property"]
----

Create a property to use as sub holding key:

[source, python, indent=0]
----
include::example$ibor/test_ibor.py[tag="create-sub-holding-key-property"]
----

Now let's create a transaction portfolio using that property as sub holding key:

[source, python, indent=0]
----
include::example$ibor/test_ibor.py[tag="portfolio-with-shk-property-key"]
include::example$ibor/test_ibor.py[tag="create-portfolio-with-shk"]
----
<1> Our property becomes a sub holding key by passing it to the `sub_holding_keys` parameter when creating a portfolio.

== Set initial holdings for instruments

== Book transactions against instruments

We have details of transactions, and their accompanying instruments in a CSV file described below:

[source, python, indent=0]
----
include::example$ibor/test_ibor.py[tag="transactions-file"]
include::example$ibor/test_ibor.py[tag="load-transactions"]
----

.Transactions
[format="csv", options="header", role="word-wrap", cols="10,11,10,12,7,10,10,8,12,10"]
|===
include::example$ibor/transactions.csv[]
|===

[TIP]
====
We are using the built-in transaction types _FundsIn_ and _Buy_.
For a full list of transaction types, see the xref:reference/transaction-types/index.adoc#default-transaction-types[transaction types reference guide].
====

You can import transactions with the strategy passed in as a property using the code below:

[source,python,indent=0]
----
include::example$ibor/test_ibor.py[tag="import-transactions-shk"]
----
<1> Sub holding key properties are specified as normal properties on transactions

[NOTE]
====
For the transaction that loads cash into our portfolio we need to use a different identifier than for the shares.
For more information about instrument identifiers, see xref:ROOT:how-to/instrument-identifiers.adoc[].
====

== Specify a corporate action

A xref:reference/corporate-action.adoc[corporate action] is an activity that a company does that causes an economic change to all holders of an instrument at a particular point in time.
Common corporate actions are stock splits, spin-offs, and dividends.

Before creating a corporate action, we need to create a corporate action source:

[source, python, indent=0]
----
include::example$ibor/test_ibor.py[tag="corporate-action-source-code"]

include::example$ibor/test_ibor.py[tag="create-corporate-action-source"]
----

And then attach that corporate action source to our transaction portfolio:

[source, python, indent=0]
----
include::example$ibor/test_ibor.py[tag="corporate-action-created-at"]
include::example$ibor/test_ibor.py[tag="add-corporate-action-portfolio"]
----

Now we're going to create a corporate action that represents a $10 dividend for each Coinbase share.

We'll need to create a Corporate Action Transition Request to do this.
Corporate Action Transition Requests are formed of input and output transitions, in which we specify the ratio of units and cost to apply.

In our case for every 1 unit of CoinBase (`Figi: "BBG00ZGF7HS6"`), we should get 10 units of USD.
You can create the following Corporate Action Transition Request to represent this transition:

[source, python, indent=0]
----
include::example$ibor/test_ibor.py[tag="create-transition"]
----

When we create a corporate action, we also need to define announcement, ex-dividend, record, and payment dates.
We'll set those to be a range of dates from 1st February 2020 through the 4th February 2020.

You can apply this corporate action by running the following code:

[source, python, indent=0]
----
include::example$ibor/test_ibor.py[tag="upsert-transition"]
----

This will mean that from the 4th February 2020, our portfolio will have an extra $10 for each CoinBase share that we held on that date.
We had 500 CoinBase shares, so that translates into $5,000.


== Examine input and output transactions (build_transactions?)
