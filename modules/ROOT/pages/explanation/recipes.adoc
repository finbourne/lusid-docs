= Recipes

Recipes in LUSID are a set of instructions for the valuation engine to determine how pricing will be conducted as well as what data will be used in the process.


Recipes are used to define the behaviour of the following LUSID sub-systems:

* Market data: How the value of a market data price <item/element> is derived based on data source, quality and hierarchy rules.
* Holdings: How a set of holdings is constructed from by the Movements Engine from transactions and corporate actions in the Event Register.
* Pricing (Analytics): How a unitised PV (and other results) are to be calculated based on the engine to be used, the library or model from that engine and the model options/parameters.
* Reference data: The classification scheme to be used.
* Results/Aggregation: How the results of the analytics calculations are aggregated and broken out, and where the results are to be stored.
