= Transaction Types

LUSID has a flexible transaction modelling system.
This means that you can configure the economic impact of your own transaction types. 

For example, you could define a transaction code of "Buy", "B", or "IBOR_BUY", which all have the same meaning:

* Increase the amount of an instrument in a portfolio .
* Decrease the amount of cash in a portfolio.

If, at a later date, a new source of data is added to LUSID which has a new transaction type of “Purchase”, but has the same underlying economic requirement (increase amount of the instrument, decrease cash) then that type can simply be added to the current configuration.

The idea here is simple but powerful – LUSID is not concerned with naming conventions of transaction codes in external systems, we only care about the economic impact of these transaction codes.
