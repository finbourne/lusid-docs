= Movements Engine
:description: LUSID's movement engine takes a portfolio's transaction history and converts it into holdings.

LUSID is a transaction based system.
To generate the holdings of a portfolio, LUSID runs the entire portfolio's transaction history through what is known as the Movements Engine.

Inside the Movements Engine each transaction is decomposed into the underlying economic _movements_.
The movements that make up a transaction are based on the transaction's type and can be configured via the transaction type configuration.

The effect of each movement is applied to generate the holdings of the portfolio.
